    "In the last example, we used the ArcGIS Python API to search for content hosted on ArcGIS Online. Here, we change things a bit and look at the process of obtaining data if you only have the URL for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when exploring data in ArcGIS Pro, we searched for `gas station NC` and found a nice map service that displayed the locations of all the gas stations in North Carolina. By looking at its properties, we discovered the URL associated with this service: https://services.nconemap.gov/secure/rest/services/NC1Map_Energy/MapServer. And by exploring the web site associated with this service, we found a treasure trove of other useful services: https://services.nconemap.gov/secure/rest/services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that if you add `arcgis/rest/services` or perhaps just `rest/services` to a Google search on a keyword, you might discover other geospatial data services that may be helpful to your objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explore how we can extract data from these services and save them as local feature classes. This again leverages the **ArcGIS Python API**. We'll use the example of the Gas Stations service we found, but this should work with any similar site.  "
