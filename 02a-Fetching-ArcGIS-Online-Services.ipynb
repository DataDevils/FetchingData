    "The **ArcGIS Python API** is a powerful Python package for interacting with ArcGIS Online resources. ESRI provides ample documentation on this tool here: https://developers.arcgis.com/python/. Here, we'll use the API to <u>download MJB&A's exit data to a local shapefile</u>. \n",
    "\n",
    "We certainly won't have time to explore all this technology has to offer, but we will get at least a sample of what it can do. To explore further more effectively, I suggest you spend a bit of time familairizing yourself with the structure of the help documentation. \n",

I recommend starting by perusing the guide, to get a feel for just what the API's capabilities are, then perhaps run through some examples and tinker with them. Use the API reference to look up specific what specific programming objects can do. And don't forget that Googleing/StackExchange can be useful resources as well...\n",
