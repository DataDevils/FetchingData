    "\n",
    "### ♦ What is an API?\n",
    "Every time you browse a web site, you are sending a **request** from your browser (or **client**) to a remote **server** to send back the **content** in a format that your browser can interpret and display. Often, the actual request you send can be seen in the web site's URL, which includes the address of the server, the service name, and parameters for the service. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Try this**:\n",
    "> * Open Google's home page: https://google.com\n",
    "> * Search for \"Nicholas School of the Environment\" \n",
    "> * When complete, look at the web address of the search results page. \n",
    "> * Simplified, the address is https://google.com/search?q=Nicholas+School+of+the+Environment. \n",
    "> * Can you identify the `service address`, `service name`, and `parameters` in the above URL? \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are the set of services and parameters that a particular client (e.g. Google) provides, and they are the basis for a lot of client/server or \"cloud\" computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ♦ How to use an API\n",
    "Many data portals have APIs that allow us to request specific datasets and download them to our local machine. Here we examine some of NREL's API and how we can use these APIs to extract electric vehicle charging locations as a CSV file with coordinates. To use this API, you'll need to sign up for an API key - a unique identifier that allows NREL to track usage and ensure that no single user is overloading the service with requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explore the NREL API**:\n",
    "> * Navigate to the NREL API main site: https://developer.nrel.gov/\n",
    "> * Examine the various themese in which APIs are provided. **Then sign up for a key.** <br>→*Create a new text document called `NRELkey.txt` and save your key in that file.* \n",
    "> * Navigate to the group of transportation related APIs: https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/\n",
    "> * And from there, navigate to APIs on [alternative fuel stations](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You see they have various ways of extracting stations. You can just ask to get all stations, a specific station, or even do some rudimentary spatial analysis to filter stations geographically. So let's look at how to engage these APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ♦ Python packages used to retrive data via APIs\n",
    "We'll use the Python `requests` package to send our request and handle the response (i.e. the data returned). And we'll use `Pandas` to wrangle the data returned into a nicely formatted dataframe and export as a tidy CSV file. "
