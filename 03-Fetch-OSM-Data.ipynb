    "## Fetch Open Street Map (OSM) data\n",
    "\n",
    "â–º *This procedure is based on the University of Helskinki tutorial ([LINK](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L6/retrieve_osm_data.html)) and the OSMNX documentation site ([LINK](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/))*\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment. It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse to mention a few. You can view the map at www.openstreetmap.org. You can also sign up as a contributor if you want to edit the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM has a large userbase with more than 4 million users and over a million contributers that update actively the OSM database with 3 million changesets per day. In total OSM contains 5 billion nodes that form the basis of the digitally mapped world that OSM provides (stats from November 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap is used not only for integrating the OSM maps as background maps to visualizations or online maps, but also for many other purposes such as routing, geocoding, education, and research. OSM is also widely used for humanitarian response e.g. in crisis areas (e.g. after natural disasters) and for fostering economic development (see more from Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) website).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `osmnx` package is an invaluable tool for extracting data from OSM. ([Read more...](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/). It works by defining an area, which can be done easily with its build in geocoder, and using that area to extract features into a [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) [geodataframe](https://geopandas.org/data_structures.html) or as a [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/) [graph](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/introduction.html#graphs) object (both of which we will discuss later).
